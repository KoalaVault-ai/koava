KoalaVault Proprietary License

Copyright (c) 2025 KoalaVault and respective model rightsholders.
All rights reserved. Last updated: 2025-10-30

IMPORTANT: This is NOT an open-source license. This license governs the
redistribution of encrypted model artifacts only. Any decryption, execution, or
use of the model requires a separate, valid license from KoalaVault (the model
marketplace that hosts license authorization).

1. Definitions
    1.1 "Encrypted Artifacts" means the model files provided in encrypted form
        (e.g., CryptoTensors format), accompanied by metadata.
    1.2 "Licensed Use" means any action that decrypts, executes, runs inference
        with, modifies, or otherwise uses the model beyond merely holding or
        forwarding the Encrypted Artifacts.
    1.3 "Authorized Tools" means KoalaVault-approved tooling and runtime that
        validate your license and perform decryption under policy controls.

2. Limited Redistribution Grant (Encrypted Artifacts Only)
    Subject to this License, you are granted a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, royalty-free right to possess and redistribute the exact,
    unmodified Encrypted Artifacts. This grant does NOT include any right to:
    - decrypt, execute, run inference with, or otherwise use the model;
    - modify the Encrypted Artifacts or produce derivative works of the model.

3. Licensed Use Requires KoalaVault Authorization
    Any Licensed Use of the model requires you (or your organization) to obtain
    and maintain a valid license issued and hosted by KoalaVault, tied to your
    account/identity. Such license is separate from this redistribution license
    and may impose additional terms, including usage scope, seat limits, and
    technical policy controls. The publisher retains all intellectual property
    rights in the model.

4. Restrictions
    Unless you have a valid KoalaVault-issued license covering the intended
    activity, you must NOT:
    - decrypt, execute, or run inference with the model;
    - circumvent or attempt to circumvent encryption, license checks, or policy
      controls;
    - modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works from the model;
    - reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source or
      plaintext weights from the Encrypted Artifacts;
    - remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices or attributions.

5. Attribution and Integrity
    When redistributing the Encrypted Artifacts, you must:
    - retain this License file unmodified; and
    - include a clear notice that Licensed Use requires a KoalaVault license.

6. Termination
    This License terminates automatically if you breach its terms. Upon
    termination, you must cease redistribution and destroy copies in your
    control, except where retention is required by law. Sections 3–9 survive
    termination.

7. No Warranty
    THE ENCRYPTED ARTIFACTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT
    ENCRYPTION OR ACCESS CONTROLS ARE ERROR-FREE.

8. Limitation of Liability
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL KOALAVAULT OR THE
    PUBLISHER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
    PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS, DATA, OR USE, EVEN IF
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT
    EXCEED THE AMOUNTS (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU FOR A KOALAVAULT LICENSE COVERING THE
    RELEVANT USE.

9. Platform Compliance (e.g., Hugging Face)
    When publishing the Encrypted Artifacts on third-party platforms, you must
    ensure the repository contains: (a) this License; and (b) a compliance notice
    clearly stating the model is encrypted, not open source, and requires a
    KoalaVault license for any use beyond redistribution. This helps prevent
    misrepresentation and user confusion.
