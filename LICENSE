    - sublicense, lease, rent, sell, or otherwise transfer the Software or any
      portion thereof;

5. Data and Telemetry
    The Software may process data necessary to perform its intended functions
    (e.g., encryption metadata, configuration, repository information).
    KoalaVault does not claim ownership over your model content. Any optional
    telemetry, if present, would be governed by KoalaVault's privacy policy.
